Highlights:

I created the Cube class by defining the vertices' indices, normals, and positions.
  
I implemented Fractal Brownian Motion (FBM) noise for the custom frag shader, the color also alternates over time.

Cube's vertex positions are changed in the verts custom shader through trigonometric functions.
