//This is a vertex shader. While it is called a "shader" due to outdated conventions, this file
//is used to apply matrix transformations to the arrays of vertex data passed to it.
//Since this code is run on your GPU, each vertex is transformed simultaneously.
//If it were run on your CPU, each vertex would have to be processed in a FOR loop, one at a time.
//This simultaneous transformation allows your program to run much faster, especially when rendering
//geometry with millions of vertices.
